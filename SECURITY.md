# Security Improvements Applied

## Overview
This document outlines the security improvements implemented to protect the PHP Site Monitor application from unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories.

## Changes Made

### 1. View Templates Moved Outside Public Directory
- **Before**: View templates were in `public/views/` (directly accessible)
- **After**: View templates moved to `views/` (outside web root)
- **Protection**: Templates cannot be accessed directly via HTTP requests

### 2. Updated Application Routing
- All `include 'views/...'` statements updated to `include '../views/...'`
- Application constant `APP_RUNNING` added to prevent direct access
- Security check file added to all view templates

### 3. Nginx Security Rules Added
- Deny access to sensitive file extensions: `.env`, `.log`, `.ini`, `.conf`, `.sql`, `.yml`, `.yaml`
- Deny access to composer files: `composer.json`, `composer.lock`, `package.json`
- Deny access to directories: `/views/`, `/src/`, `/vendor/`, `/config/`
- Deny access to `.git/` directory
- Deny access to PHP files outside public directory

### 4. Apache .htaccess Protection
- Added `.htaccess` files to sensitive directories:
  - `views/.htaccess` - Denies all access to view templates
  - `src/.htaccess` - Denies all access to source code
  - `vendor/.htaccess` - Denies all access to vendor libraries
  - `config/.htaccess` - Denies all access to configuration files

### 5. Application-Level Security
- Added `views/security.php` with direct access prevention
- All view files now include security check at the top
- Validates `APP_RUNNING` constant is defined
- Redirects unauthenticated users to login (except for login/register pages)

### 6. SEO and Crawler Protection
- Added `robots.txt` to prevent search engine indexing of sensitive areas
- Disallows crawling of `/views/`, `/src/`, `/vendor/`, `/config/` directories
- Disallows access to configuration and log files

## Security Benefits

1. **Prevents Source Code Exposure**: View templates and PHP source code cannot be accessed directly
2. **Configuration Protection**: Database credentials and environment variables cannot be accessed
3. **Dependency Protection**: Vendor libraries and composer files are protected
4. **Multiple Layers**: Both web server and application-level protection
5. **Cross-Platform**: Works with both Nginx and Apache servers

## Testing Security

To verify the security improvements:

1. **Test Direct View Access**: 
   - Try accessing `http://localhost/views/dashboard.php` (should return 403/404)
   
2. **Test Source Code Access**:
   - Try accessing `http://localhost/src/Models/User.php` (should return 403/404)
   
3. **Test Configuration Access**:
   - Try accessing `http://localhost/.env` (should return 403/404)
   - Try accessing `http://localhost/composer.json` (should return 403/404)

4. **Test Application Functionality**:
   - Verify that the main application at `http://localhost` still works correctly
   - Ensure all pages load through the proper routing system

## Maintenance Notes

- When adding new view files, ensure they include the security check: `<?php require_once __DIR__ . '/security.php'; ?>`
- Keep nginx security rules updated when adding new sensitive file types
- Regularly review and update security configurations
- Monitor access logs for attempted unauthorized access

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Rate limiting for login attempts
- Additional input validation and sanitization
- Security audit logging
- HTTPS enforcement (when using in production)
