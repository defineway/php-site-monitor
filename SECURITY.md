# Security Improvements Applied

## Overview
This document outlines the security improvements implemented to protect the PHP Site Monitor application from unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories.

## Changes Made

### 1. MVC Architecture Implementation
- **Before**: View templates were in `public/views/` (directly accessible)
- **After**: Complete MVC restructure with views in `src/Views/` (protected within src directory)
- **Protection**: Templates cannot be accessed directly via HTTP requests and are rendered through controllers

### 2. Controller-Based Routing System
- Implemented proper MVC with Router class routing requests to appropriate controllers
- All business logic moved to dedicated Controller classes (AuthController, DashboardController, SiteController, UserController)
- Controllers handle authentication checks before rendering views
- Application constant `APP_RUNNING` added to prevent direct access

### 3. Nginx Security Rules Added
- Deny access to sensitive file extensions: `.env`, `.log`, `.ini`, `.conf`, `.sql`, `.yml`, `.yaml`
- Deny access to composer files: `composer.json`, `composer.lock`, `package.json`
- Deny access to directories: `/src/`, `/vendor/`, `/config/` (views now protected within src)
- Deny access to `.git/` directory
- Deny access to PHP files outside public directory

### 4. Apache .htaccess Protection
- Added `.htaccess` files to sensitive directories:
  - `src/.htaccess` - Denies all access to source code (including views)
  - `vendor/.htaccess` - Denies all access to vendor libraries
  - `config/.htaccess` - Denies all access to configuration files

### 5. Application-Level Security
- Added `src/Views/security.php` with direct access prevention
- All view files now include security check at the top
- Validates `APP_RUNNING` constant is defined
- Controller-level authentication and authorization checks
- Views rendered only through authenticated controller methods

### 6. SEO and Crawler Protection
- Added `robots.txt` to prevent search engine indexing of sensitive areas
- Disallows crawling of `/src/`, `/vendor/`, `/config/` directories
- Disallows access to configuration and log files

### 7. MVC Security Benefits
- **Controller-level authorization**: All routes protected by appropriate permission checks
- **Centralized authentication**: Authentication logic handled in BaseController
- **Secure view rendering**: Views can only be rendered through controller methods
- **Input validation**: Controllers validate and sanitize all user inputs before processing

## Security Benefits

1. **MVC Architecture Security**: Complete separation of concerns with controller-based access control
2. **Enhanced View Protection**: Views are within the src directory and cannot be accessed directly
3. **Controller-level Authentication**: All protected routes require authentication through controllers
4. **Prevents Source Code Exposure**: All PHP source code and view templates are protected
5. **Configuration Protection**: Database credentials and environment variables cannot be accessed
6. **Dependency Protection**: Vendor libraries and composer files are protected
7. **Multiple Layers**: Web server, application-level, and controller-level protection
8. **Cross-Platform**: Works with both Nginx and Apache servers

## Testing Security

To verify the security improvements:

1. **Test Direct View Access**: 
   - Try accessing `http://localhost/src/Views/dashboard.php` (should return 403/404)
   
2. **Test Source Code Access**:
   - Try accessing `http://localhost/src/Models/User.php` (should return 403/404)
   - Try accessing `http://localhost/src/Controllers/AuthController.php` (should return 403/404)
   
3. **Test Configuration Access**:
   - Try accessing `http://localhost/.env` (should return 403/404)
   - Try accessing `http://localhost/composer.json` (should return 403/404)

4. **Test Application Functionality**:
   - Verify that the main application at `http://localhost` still works correctly
   - Ensure all pages load through the proper MVC routing system
   - Test that authentication is required for protected routes

## Maintenance Notes

- When adding new view files, ensure they include the security check: `<?php require_once __DIR__ . '/security.php'; ?>`
- New controllers should extend BaseController for consistent authentication and rendering
- Keep nginx security rules updated when adding new sensitive file types
- All new routes should be added to the Router class with appropriate authentication requirements
- Regularly review and update security configurations
- Monitor access logs for attempted unauthorized access

## MVC Architecture Overview

The application now follows a proper MVC pattern:
- **Models** (`src/Models/`): Handle data access and business logic
- **Views** (`src/Views/`): Handle presentation layer (secured within src)
- **Controllers** (`src/Controllers/`): Handle request routing and user interaction
- **Router** (`src/Controllers/Router.php`): Central routing system mapping URLs to controller methods

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Rate limiting for login attempts
- Additional input validation and sanitization
- Security audit logging
- HTTPS enforcement (when using in production)
