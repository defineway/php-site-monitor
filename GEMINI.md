# Project: PHP Site Monitor

> **Note:** This file is project documentation and should be included in version control (git).

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive PHP-based application to monitor the uptime of various websites and check SSL certificates expiration. Built with a modern MVC architecture, it features a complete user authentication system, role-based access control, and a beautiful responsive web interface. The application uses MySQL for data persistence and includes advanced user management capabilities with safety protections. Docker containerization ensures consistent deployment and includes phpMyAdmin for database management.

## Current Status
‚úÖ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - The project has evolved significantly from a basic monitoring tool to a feature-rich web application with:
- Complete user authentication and authorization system
- Modern MVC architecture with custom routing
- Advanced user management with role-based access control
- Responsive UI with Bootstrap 5 and Font Awesome icons
- Security hardening and session management
- Visual statistics dashboard
- Safety protections (prevent self-deletion, last admin protection)
- **Background monitoring** via cron job

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: PHP 8.2 with MVC architecture
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0 with comprehensive schema
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5, Font Awesome 6.4.0, responsive design
- **Authentication**: Custom session-based system with role management
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Web Server**: Nginx (configured in Docker)
- **Database Management**: phpMyAdmin (http://localhost:8080)
- **Package Management**: Composer for PHP dependencies
- **Version Control**: Git with comprehensive .gitignore
- **Testing**: PHPUnit for unit and integration tests

## Commands
- **Install dependencies**: `composer install`
- **Start application**: `docker-compose up -d --build`
- **Run monitor script (manual)**: `docker-compose exec app php monitor.php`
- **Run with debug**: `docker-compose exec app php monitor.php --debug`
- **Run tests**: `vendor/bin/phpunit` or `docker-compose exec app vendor/bin/phpunit`
- **Access phpMyAdmin**: Open http://localhost:8080 in browser
- **View logs**: `docker-compose logs -f app` or `docker-compose exec app tail -f logs/monitor.log`

## Cron Job Setup
To run the monitoring script automatically, you can set up a cron job.

1.  **Open your crontab:**
    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```

2.  **Add the following line to run the monitor every minute:**
    ```bash
    * * * * * cd /path/to/your/project && /usr/bin/docker-compose exec -T app php monitor.php >> /dev/null 2>&1
    ```
    > **Note:** Replace `/path/to/your/project` with the absolute path to your project directory.
